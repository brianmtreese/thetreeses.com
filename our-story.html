		<p>Brian and I seemed to cross each other’s paths a few times before actually getting together.&nbsp;Sort of
			like when you enter a room and you feel like you just missed the best part of the party.&nbsp;It all began
			at a little place called The Cliffs Resort.&nbsp;I started as a restaurant manager in September of
			2006.&nbsp;Brian was working as a server but we never officially met (he worked nights, I worked
			days).&nbsp;He quit The Cliffs three months later, but we had a lot of friends in common.</p>

				height="367">Our first encounter was Valentine’s Day 2008.&nbsp;I went out to dinner with my best friend
			Hali, as we were both single.&nbsp;Dinner led to drinks, and drinks&nbsp; led to dancing.&nbsp;I ran into
			Brian while I was out.&nbsp;There was an instant&nbsp; chemistry there, and we were by each other’s side the
			rest of the night.&nbsp;I ended up losing my entire purse towards the end of the evening (which if&nbsp;you
			know me, you know that is very typical); my phone, keys, everything gone.&nbsp;It ended up being turned in
			to the police, but I had already ordered a &nbsp; new phone.&nbsp; Brian had text messaged me that night
			saying he hoped I made it home okay.&nbsp;When I didn’t respond, he figured I wasn’t interested.&nbsp;Little
			did he know that I was missing my phone.</p>
		<h2 class="content-sub-header" style="clear: both;">A few months go by…</h2>
		<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-42"

				src="{{ '/assets/images/OurStory/concert.jpg' | relative_url }}"
				alt="Saw each other at a  concert &amp; ingnored  each other" width="235" height="289">We run into each
			other at a concert, as we still had mutual friends.&nbsp;I ignored Brian and he ignored me.&nbsp;I really
			wanted to talk to him, but I felt shy and awkward.&nbsp;He thought I didn’t like him because he never heard
			from me after Valentine’s Day.&nbsp;I talked about my feelings with a friend that night, but didn’t make a
			move.</p>
		<h2 class="content-sub-header">Seven months go by…</h2>
		<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-44" title="I move to  San Diego"
				src="{{ '/assets/images/OurStory/san-diego.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="I move to  San Diego" width="229" height="277">I
			had moved to San Diego!&nbsp;I was in search of a fresh start in a big city.&nbsp;I was feeling healthier
			and happier than I had in a long time, and was finally feeling “normal” about being single.&nbsp;I had
			settled into my own skin.&nbsp; Then I started hearing how Brian might still be interested in me.&nbsp;He
			was also hearing that I might be interested in him.&nbsp;Our sneaky friends Dan and Egin were trying to
			gently push us together.</p>
		<h2 class="content-sub-header" style="clear: both;">A month later…</h2>
		<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-45"
				title="Our 1st offical date is at  a Padres &amp; Rockies game"
				src="{{ '/assets/images/OurStory/petco-park.webp' | relative_url }}"
				alt="Our 1st offical date is at  a Padres &amp; Rockies game" width="270" height="264">Brian drove the six hours down to San Diego to visit me (which
			if you know Brian, is not typical of him). We both took a leap of faith. We had our first date at a Padres
			vs. Rockies baseball game. Two weeks later, he came back to San Diego. And we spent the next ten months
			making that trek almost every two weeks. We had finally met our person.</p>
		<h2 class="content-sub-header">Thanksgiving 2010…</h2>
		<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-46"
				title="Thanksgiving day  in Spokane, Brian  asks me to marry him"
				src="{{ '/assets/images/OurStory/thanksgiving-turkey.jpg' | relative_url }}"
				alt="Thanksgiving day  in Spokane, Brian  asks me to marry him" width="275" height="284">Brian and I
			decided to spend Thanksgiving with my family in Spokane, Washington. We woke up on Thanksgiving morning like
			any other morning. Brian got up first while I was still in the waking up process. He came back in the room,
			and was down on the floor at the foot of the bed. He kept saying, “What’s on the floor over here? Really,
			what is this?” I thought he was a crazy person. But I crawled to the end of the bed anyway. When I got
			there, he had the ring box open and asked me to be his pal forever.</p>
		<h2 class="content-sub-header" style="clear: both;">Ten hours later…</h2>
		<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-47"
				title="Less than ten hours  after saying yes, the  ring is lost in the snow"
				src="{{ '/assets/images/OurStory/snowy-road.jpg' | relative_url }}"
				alt="Less than ten hours  after saying yes, the  ring is lost in the snow" width="291" height="259">I
			dropped the ring in the snow! After a twelve hour search with three different metal detectors, and lots of
			family and friends, we finally found it. It was the worst twelve hours we’ve ever experienced, but we
			continued to treat each other lovingly throughout. Brian was very determined and patient. We learned that in
			times of stress, we pull together not break apart.</p>
		<h2 class="content-sub-header">Today…</h2>
		<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48" title="Jen and Brian"
				src="{{ '/assets/images/OurStory/jen-and-brian.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Jen and Brian" width="251" height="201">Now, we
			will always have each other’s love and support. We couldn’t be more excited to share our lives with one
			another!</p>
