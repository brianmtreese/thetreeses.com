                    <p>Nobody can make me giggle like Rebecca can! We can joke and make fun of each other (mostly she’s
                        making fun of me) until I’m not even sure what we’re laughing at. She’s my littlest baby sister,
                        and sometimes I forget that she’s all grown up now. I’m proud to call her my Maid of Honor.</p>

                    <p>Cathrine is closest to my age. Growing up, we fought all the time! We would steal each other’s
                        clothes, scream, yell, and slam doors. Now I look forward to calls from my niece Chloe, wanting
                        to say goodnight to “Aunt Jenny”. We can talk to each other about anything. My day would not be
                        complete without her standing up there with me.</p>

                    <p>Hali and I have been friends for almost five years now. She was an HR intern at the Cliffs way
                        back when, and actually did my new hire paperwork with me! We’ve seen each other through a lot
                        of good times and bad times (nothing that champagne and Sex and the City couldn’t cure). She’s a
                        part of my family and vice versa. You’ll find her on the dance floor ;)</p>

                    <p>A truly “unique” individual who has managed to keep me on my toes for over fifteen years now.
                        From little league to the halls of high school to college and beyond he’s been there every step
                        of the way. For a guy who rarely wears a shirt with sleeves it will be great to have him there
                        supporting me in a tux.</p>

                    <div class="bridal-party-person-role"><span>(Best Man)</span></div>
                    <p>I almost had to find another guy to fill this spot on the wedding day roster after he recently
                        announced that he was converting from a life long Dodgers fan to an SF Giants fan. But after
                        recalling the many times that he drove twenty miles out of his way to pick me up before school
                        just so I wouldn’t have to ride the bus I realized that Dan is one of the best friends a guy can
                        have. I’m honored that he will be up there with me on the big day.</p>

                    <p>If ever I’ve found myself down in the dumps he’s been the one to call. Jake is the life of every
                        party and can swing dance with the best of them (ladies beware). After moving to San Luis Obispo
                        he became a roommate, a best friend, and a partner in crime. Jake will always put his whole
                        heart into whatever he is doing and it will mean a lot to have there by my side.</p>
